# Industrial-Human-Resource-Geo-Visualization-Geo-
Introduction : In India, the industrial classification of the workforce is essential to understand the distribution of the labor force across various sectors. The classification of main workers and marginal workers, other than cultivators and agricultural laborers, by sex and by section, division, and class, has been traditionally used to understand the economic status and employment trends in the country. However, the current data on this classification is outdated and may not accurately reflect the current state of the workforce. The aim of this study is to update the information on the industrial classification of the main and marginal workers, other than cultivators and agricultural laborers, by sex and by section, division, and class, to provide relevant and accurate data for policy making and employment planning.

Domain : Resource Management

Prerequisites
Python -- Programming Language
pandas -- Python Library for Data Visualization
numpy -- Fundamental Python package for scientific computing in Python
streamlit -- Python framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps
scikit-learn -- Machine Learning library for the Python programming language
Natural Language Processing (NLP) -- A library in Python for working with human language data, including tokenization, stemming, tagging, and more.
Approach
The following is a fundamental outline of the project:

Data Merging: Merge provided CSV data files to create a comprehensive DataFrame.

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore and clean the data, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize industries into groups such as Retail, Poultry, Agriculture, and Manufacturing.

Machine Learning: Perform machine learning tasks, including training a model to predict relevant workforce features.

Geo-Visualization: Develop a dashboard app using Streamlit and Plotly to visually represent the distribution of workers across various industries with respect to different geographical regions.
